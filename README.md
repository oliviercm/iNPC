# Description

iNPC - Artifical Intelligence Module (Improved NPC AI)

iNPC (Improved NPCs) is an addon that adds huge improvements to the existing HL2 NPCs.

If you find that the NPCs in GMod are dumb, or too easy to fight, then iNPC will solve your problems.

iNPC's goal is to make NPCs a challenge to fight, and add new dynamics to the classic NPC battle, creating a totally different experience compared to regular GMod. As such, it will considerably increase the difficulty fighting against NPCs.

[b]Note:[/b] For intended results, the map must contain NPC nodes. Unnoded maps will not be able to use iNPC to its fullest.
[b]Note:[/b] iNPC only affects the regular HL2 NPCs, including reskins. Non-HL2 NPCs from mods such as VJBase will usually not be affected.
